# Quarto book for debug figure path

### Problem

Plot can't be displayed for MS Word output if the source file is in a subdirectory 

Please see [this source file](./subdir/intro.qmd) and [MS Word output](_book/Quarto-debug-figure-path.docx)

I notice that [`_book/subdir/intro_files/`](_book/subdir/intro_files/) doesn't have `figure-docx` as it should be?
