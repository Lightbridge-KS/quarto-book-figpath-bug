## Plot

This plot ([@fig-cars-bug]) not working for `docx` output, but `html` output OK.

```{r}
#| label: fig-cars-bug
#| fig-cap: distance vs speed
plot(cars)
```

For MS Word output, Quarto can't find this plot path because `figure-docx` doesn't exist in `_book/subdir/intro_files`.

The following error message is generated.

```
